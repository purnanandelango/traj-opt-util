example 9   : 	grasp force optimization for a 3D block using three-finger manipulator
formulation : 	constrained LQR
constraints :
    	      	friction cone on grasping force
              	upper bound on l2 norm of grasp force
    		  	rotational equilibrium
               	upper bound on box velocity
